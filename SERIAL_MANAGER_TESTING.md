```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **1. No Serial Ports Found**
**Symptoms:** "No serial ports found" or empty port list
**Solutions:**
- Connect your CNC controller via USB
- Check Device Manager for COM ports
- Install USB drivers if needed
- Try different USB cable/port

### **2. Connection Fails**
**Symptoms:** "Failed to connect" or connection timeout
**Solutions:**
- Check if port is in use by another application
- Try different baudrates (9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, 115200)
- Ensure device is powered on
- Check USB drivers

### **3. No Response from Device**
**Symptoms:** Connected but no data received
**Solutions:**
- Check device firmware compatibility
- Try different G-code commands
- Verify device is in correct mode
- Check device documentation

### **4. UI Issues**
**Symptoms:** Application crashes or UI doesn't respond
**Solutions:**
- Check PySide6 installation
- Verify all dependencies are installed
- Check for Python version compatibility

## 📊 Testing Checklist

### **Basic Tests**
- [ ] Run `python test_serial_manager.py`
- [ ] Verify all tests pass
- [ ] Check port enumeration works
- [ ] Confirm UI components load

### **Hardware Tests**
- [ ] Connect CNC controller via USB
- [ ] Run `python test_hardware_connection.py`
- [ ] Test connection to device
- [ ] Verify firmware detection
- [ ] Test command sending/receiving

### **Full Application Tests**
- [ ] Run `python main.py`
- [ ] Navigate to Connection tab
- [ ] Select your device port
- [ ] Click Connect button
- [ ] Verify status changes to "Connected"
- [ ] Test sending commands from Console tab
- [ ] Test jog controls
- [ ] Test actuator commands

### **Advanced Tests**
- [ ] Test auto-reconnection (disconnect USB, reconnect)
- [ ] Test different baudrates
- [ ] Test emergency stop functionality
- [ ] Test firmware-specific commands
- [ ] Test error handling (send invalid commands)

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

### **Connection Process:**
1. **Port Selection**: Available ports listed in dropdown
2. **Connecting**: Status shows "Connecting..." (yellow)
3. **Connected**: Status shows "Connected" (green)
4. **Firmware Detection**: Firmware type displayed
5. **Ready**: All controls enabled

### **Command Sending:**
1. **Console**: Type command, press Enter or click Send
2. **Log**: Command appears in log panel
3. **Status**: Connection status remains green
4. **Response**: Device response appears in log (if any)

### **Error Handling:**
1. **Connection Lost**: Status changes to red, controls disabled
2. **Invalid Command**: Error message in log
3. **Timeout**: Timeout message in log
4. **Auto-reconnect**: Automatic reconnection attempts

## 🔍 Debug Information

### **Enable Debug Logging**
Add this to your test scripts for more detailed output:
```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

### **Check SerialManager State**
```python
# Get detailed connection info
info = manager.get_connection_info()
print(f"State: {info.state}")
print(f"Firmware: {info.firmware}")
print(f"Bytes sent: {info.bytes_sent}")
print(f"Bytes received: {info.bytes_received}")
```

### **Monitor Signals**
```python
# Connect to all signals for debugging
manager.connection_status_changed.connect(lambda s: print(f"Status: {s}"))
manager.data_received.connect(lambda r: print(f"Data: {r.raw_data}"))
manager.error_occurred.connect(lambda e: print(f"Error: {e}"))
```

## 🚀 Performance Testing

### **Command Throughput**
- Send multiple commands rapidly
- Monitor response times
- Check for command queuing

### **Connection Stability**
- Leave connection open for extended periods
